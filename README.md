VOTE SMART
codefundo2019
This is the project for codefundo2019 using azure's blockchain technology.

PURPOSE
This is crystal clear to everyone that voting is a basic process that keeps a nationâ€™s governmental system works. It enables the citizens to choose their own government. It also allows the people to choose their representatives in the government. The purpose of every government is to develop and implement various policies for the benefit of its citizens. It is pathetic that some people vote illegal in place of other people even if they are dead, many citizens are not using their right to vote and most of them do not even have a solid reason for not to vote.

IDEA
Our application is a small initiative to make the whole voting process automatic using blockchain technology and make the voting process secure and increase vote count in India.
DESCRIPTION
Our program will show 3 options - create e-voter id (verifying through aadhar card), login via e-voterid and private key provided to user during creating e-voterid, vote button. Also two statuses will be shown, 1. if the person has voted or not, 2. the voting is running or not started or finished.
On the day of election after 7-8 hrs of voting a list of people who have not yet voted for a particular booth will be published and will be sent to all the people registered at that booth and also a personal message will be sent to voter to persuade them to come and vote. Not only people will be persuaded to cast their vote under peer pressure but also as the list is published to all people in locality they can personally go and ask others to vote. This way we can make more and more people cast their vote who are not doing it out of no reason.

IMPLEMENTAION
We will store the info of voters(name, aadhar number, e-voterid(encrypted),private key(encrypted),votestatus) in a database(mysql) and store the info of parties in different table. each table of party includes - minister name, region, vote count . There will be different blockchains of votes corresponding to different parties.
