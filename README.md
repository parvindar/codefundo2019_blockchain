VOTE SMART
codefundo2019
This is the project for codefundo2019 using azure's blockchain technology.

PURPOSE
We all know that voting enables citizens to choose their own government. Through voting people can express their opinion in democratic nations .It is important that every Indian citizen should cast their vote and help their nation grow but it is found that only 60 to 70 percentage of eligible voters cast their votes. It is pathetic because many citizens are not using their right to vote and most of them do not even have a solid reason for not to vote.

IDEA
So basically our application is a small initiative to increase vote count in India.
DESCRIPTION
On the day of election after 7-8 hrs of voting a list of people who have not yet voted for a particular booth will be published and will be sent to all the people registered at that booth and also a personal message will be sent to voter to persuade them to come and vote. Not only people will be persuaded to cast their vote under peer pressure but also as the list is published to all people in locality they can personally go and ask others to vote. This way we can make more and more people cast their vote who are not doing it out of no reason.

IMPLEMENTAION
For implementation we will create one block for each booth and each booth will contain an array having all the voters registered in it. Along with sending list we will display graphical representation of voting record of every user which will show a comparison among their relatives, neighbors and friends and have a great impact on in voter turnout.
